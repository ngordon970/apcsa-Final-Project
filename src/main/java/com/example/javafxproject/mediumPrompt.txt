Switzerland is considered the most peaceful country in the world. Despite always being prepared for the possibility of war, it has never encountered any hostile army since the establishment of the Swiss Confederation in 1815, and its own army has never engaged in aggressive actions. Consequently, Switzerland remains untouched by the devastating effects of war, a distinction that no other European country can claim. The majority of Switzerland's 16,000 square mile area consists of continuous, rolling lush countryside, with pastures, vineyards, and grain farms, except for one-third of the region, which is mountainous and exceptionally beautiful. Approximately three-quarters of the population resides in small towns and villages that have preserved their exquisite medieval architecture and external appearance. Switzerland can swiftly transform itself into a fully equipped and prepared military force, effectively turning its entire nation into an army if necessary. The people of Switzerland proudly state that they do not have an army but rather are the army themselves. One unique aspect of Switzerland's military readiness is its constant state of preparedness for a nuclear attack or the aftermath of a nuclear war in its vicinity. Dr. Morgellier, the Chief Military Spokesman, mentioned some time ago that up to 80% of Switzerland's population could be relocated to underground shelters within a few hours. Local police tightly supervise every aspect of citizens' lives, leading to 100% compliance with three specific instructions: every household must maintain a reserve stock of approximately two months' worth of food and daily necessities; the entire male population must participate in civil defense exercises and be readily available for military duty; and everyone must keep their arms at the ready at all times. The government provides each household with arms and ammunition. All men between the ages of 20 and 50 are required to serve in the military, attending military colleges for 20 days annually until the age of 32, and at least one 90-day session. As a result, Switzerland's regular or standing army comprises only 65,000 personnel, yet it can mobilize 10% of its population, or 650,000 men, within 48 hours, with the rest following shortly thereafter. This level of defense preparedness has led outside observers to describe Switzerland's focus on defense as an obsession. Finance is crucial to any business, as it serves as the lifeblood of the organization. Without finance, no firm can survive. It involves managing the monetary affairs of the company, determining the best terms for raising funds, and allocating the acquired funds in the most effective manner. Thus, the nature of finance revolves around arranging and utilizing funds. It was the hunter's first time venturing outside Montana. He awoke, still haunted by the vision he had experienced hours earlier—an ascent through rose-lit cumulus, with houses and barns appearing like specks in the snow-covered valleys, the vast scrolling landscape below dressed in December-brown and black hills streaked with snow, glimpses of frozen lakes, and the long braids of a river gleaming at the bottom of a canyon. Above the airplane's wing, the sky had deepened to such a pure blue that he knew it would bring tears to his eyes if he stared at it for too long. Now, darkness surrounded him as the airplane descended over Chicago, revealing its constellation of electric lights and the gradually clearer view of the vast neighborhoods as the plane glided towards the airport. Streetlights, headlights, stacks of buildings, ice rinks, a truck turning at a stoplight, patches of snow atop a warehouse, and distant hills adorned with blinking antennae—it all passed by his window. Finally, the plane aligned with the long, converging parallel blue lights of the runway, and they touched down. He walked through the airport, passing rows of monitors. Already, he felt a sense of loss, as if he had left something behind—a beautiful perspective, a lovely dream that had slipped away. He had traveled to Chicago to see his wife, whom he hadn't seen in twenty years. She was there to showcase her talents to a higher-up at the state university. Even universities, it seemed, were interested in what she could do. Outside the terminal, the sky was thick and gray, hurried along by the wind. Snow was on its way. A representative from the university met him and escorted him to her Jeep. He kept his gaze fixed outside the window. They spent forty-five minutes in the car, passing first through the towering, illuminated structures of downtown, then naked suburban oaks, mounds of plowed snow, gas stations, power towers, and telephone wires. Finally, they arrived at an elaborate, modern mansion, with square balconies suspended over two garages, enormous triangular windows on the facade, sleek columns, domed lights, and a steep shale roof. Inside the front door, a table displayed about thirty name tags. His wife had not yet arrived. It appeared that no one had arrived yet. He found his tag and pinned it to his sweater. A silent girl dressed in a tuxedo appeared briefly to collect his coat. The granite foyer featured a grand staircase, wide at the bottom and tapering toward the top. A woman descended the stairs, stopping several steps from the bottom. She greeted the woman who had driven him there with a "Hello, Anne" and turned to him, saying, "You must be Mr. Dumas." He shook her hand—an ethereal, pale, bony thing, weightless like a featherless bird.
