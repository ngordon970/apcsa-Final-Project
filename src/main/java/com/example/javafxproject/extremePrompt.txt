When Charles Darwin was born in 1809, science was still in its infancy. Chemists were discussing atoms, while physicists focused on energy and electricity, although their understanding of these concepts was limited. By the time Darwin passed away in 1882, scientists had made significant advancements. They were able to explain light and electromagnetic waves, and thanks to Darwin, biologists could elucidate the development of life on Earth. Darwin is widely regarded as the greatest biologist of all time, with expertise in plants, animals, and insects. Surprisingly, he initially had no intention of becoming a biologist. During his school and university years, Darwin was an average student who indulged in extensive reading and collected beetles and butterflies. He pursued the study of medicine in Edinburgh but soon realized it wasn't his true calling. It was at Cambridge where he met John Steven Henslow, a fellow botanist who played a pivotal role in securing Darwin a position on the exploration ship Beagle. Over the course of five years, the Beagle circumnavigated the globe, providing Darwin with valuable insights into various life forms. Upon his return to England, Darwin had gained considerable renown as a scientist, living a secluded life in the countryside where he conducted experiments and studied plants and animals. Among his numerous readings, one book had a profound impact on him. A prominent economist proposed that as the population grew, the demand for food would increase exponentially, potentially leading to scarcity and an inability for everyone to survive and reproduce. Darwin saw this theory as applicable to animals and plants as well, where those with access to food would thrive while others perished. Shifting to another notable figure, George Gershwin, born in 1898, emerged as one of America's most celebrated composers. He published his first song at the age of eighteen and went on to write over five hundred more songs, along with an opera, piano compositions, and orchestral music, until his death in 1937. Many of Gershwin's songs were initially written for musical plays staged in New York City theaters. These comedies, enriched with numerous songs, captivated audiences during the 1920s and 1930s. One such play, "Girl Crazy," introduced a young singer named Ethel Merman, who later became a renowned performer in America. In the production, she delivered the iconic world hit "I Got Rhythm." Gershwin's songs composed for musical plays and films have endured the test of time, enjoying ongoing popularity. They have been interpreted in various genres, ranging from jazz to country. In the 1920s, a debate unfolded in the United States regarding the status of jazz music. Some questioned whether jazz could be considered serious music. In response, jazz musician and orchestra leader Paul Whiteman organized a special concert in 1924 to demonstrate the serious side of jazz. George Gershwin accepted the challenge of composing a piece for the concert, initially unaware of the limited time he had. Despite the tight deadline, he managed to create a piano and orchestra composition titled "Rhapsody in Blue." Gershwin himself performed on the piano during the concert, leaving the audience, composed of esteemed classical musicians of the time, electrified by his music. "Rhapsody in Blue" catapulted George Gershwin to worldwide fame, proving that jazz music could possess both sophistication and popularity.
